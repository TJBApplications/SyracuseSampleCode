# SyracuseSampleCode
Sample code for Syracuse M.S. in CS application - Tyler Brown

IMPORTANT NOTES BELOW

Java Basic Inventory Manager was a project I did during one of my bridge courses. I used UML to model out the application with some requirements like being able to add items to the store via a JSON file, update store inventory as items are bought and sold, hold various number of items, change the order in which the items appear in various locations, etc. 

Plurality and Runoff are problems from an online CS50x course that initially confirmed my passion for CS. These were completed prior to any formal training at a university and are still some of my favorite problems to work with. All work was done using terminal commands. 

Importantly, not all the code in these were written by me. The problems provide code for us to start with, and then I had to complete certain methods to run the program. 

The lines I wrote for plurality were 66 - 102 (Marked with TODO's as well) 
The lines I wrote for runoff were 127 - 229
